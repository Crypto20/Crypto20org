Ujo is a new shared infrastructure for the creative industries that returns more value to content creators and their customers. Our open platform uses blockchain technology to create a transparent and decentralised database of rights and rights owners and automates royalty payments using smart contracts and cryptocurrency. We hope that it will be the foundation upon which a new more transparent, more efficient and more profitable music ecosystem can be built.
 
Our team has experience of successful technology projects in both startups and large corporations and of innovative music industry projects with artists including Radiohead and Thom Yorke.
